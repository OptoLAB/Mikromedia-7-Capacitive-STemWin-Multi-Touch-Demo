# Mikromedia-7-Capacitive-STemWin-Multi-Touch-Demo
 Detecting gestures with STemWin GUI library on Mikromedia 7 Capacitive

## About project

Project demonstrates use of STemWin graphic library on STM32 mcu for detecting multi-touch gestures(zooming, rotating, moving). Project was built using following ecosystem:

 - [mikromedia+ for STM32F7](https://www.mikroe.com/mikromedia-7-capacitive) with development board by Mikroelektronika with STM32F767BI ([MCU CARD 23](https://www.mikroe.com/mcu-card-23-for-stm32-stm32f767bi))
 - [STM32CubeIDE 1.3.0](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) - Integrated Development Environment for STM32 with [STM32CubeMX 5.6.0](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) initialization code generator by STMicroelectronics
 - ST-LINK/V2 - in-circuit debugger and programmer for the STM8 and STM32 microcontroller families
